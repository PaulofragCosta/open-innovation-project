# Open Innovation Project

Welcome to the Open Innovation Project repository! This is a collaborative space where we explore the concept of open innovation and develop new ideas together. Whether you're a student, researcher, or simply interested in innovation, you're invited to contribute.

## What is Open Innovation?
Open innovation is a business model that encourages companies and individuals to use external and internal ideas to advance their technology. It's about collaboration, sharing knowledge, and creating value for everyone involved.
